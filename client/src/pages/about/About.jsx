              The name "Intartica" itself is a creative evolution, symbolizing a
              journey from a "collection of art" to "Collection of Interior Art"
              and culminating in the concept of the "Continent of Interiors." It
              encapsulates our philosophy of creating a collection of art that
              goes beyond mere aesthetics, combining form and function to design
              interiors that are not just beautiful but also have healing
              capabilities for the soul.
